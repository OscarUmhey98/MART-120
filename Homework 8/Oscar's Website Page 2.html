<h1>The Coder</h1>
<body>Once there was a wise coder named Oscar who was enrolled in a creative coding class. He would dominate the competition in every kahoot quiz throughout the semester, annihilating all who opposed him. On the last kahoot quiz, he had mercy and allowed Cain to take 1st place because Oscar was a generous king of kahoot. The end.
